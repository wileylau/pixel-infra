# Bugs #

Sadly, nothing is perfect. Yes, we admit, the port may have bugs. We are trying our best to fix it, to resemble the experience of using a real Pixel on your phone.

Common bugs include:
- Now Playing (Missing binaries)
- Ok Google (Missing binaries)
- Decryption (Just leave your device encrypted.)
